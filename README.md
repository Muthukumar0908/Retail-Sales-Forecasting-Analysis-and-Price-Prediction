# Retail-Sales-Forecasting-Analysis-and-Price-Prediction
**Data Analysis and Price Prediction**



In this project, I worked with three types of CSV files: stores_data_set.csv, sales_data_set.csv, and Features_data_set.csv. My initial step was to join all the datasets to create a unified dataset for analysis.

**Key Steps:**

**Data Integration:**

The three CSV files are joined to create a comprehensive dataset.
**Data Cleaning:**

The dataset undergoes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify and replace null values.
**Markdown Value Prediction:** 

Machine learning models are employed to predict missing MarkDown values using weekly sales data.
**Hypothesis Testing:** 

Statistical tests are applied to validate assumptions about the data.
**Sales Price Prediction:**

Dates are transformed into month, week, and day formats to forecast sales prices for various years and dates.
**Feature Analysis:** 

Correlation and feature importance analyses are conducted to select the most relevant predictors.
**Model Development:** 

A predictive model is built, achieving an accuracy of 89%.
**Implementation:** 

The model is integrated into a Streamlit app for interactive predictions.
**Visualization:**

A Power BI dashboard is created to analyze the impact of fuel prices and holidays on weekly sales.
